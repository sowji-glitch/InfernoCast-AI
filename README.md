# InfernoCast-AI
This repository contains the submission for the BigQuery AI Hackathon. Our project demonstrates how to fuse structured, unstructured, and image data to create a real-time wildfire risk forecast.

Problem: Wildfire prediction is a classic "siloed data" problem.
Solution: We use BigQuery's multimodal capabilities to analyze weather data, text alerts, and satellite imagery simultaneously.
